# FHL-Tracker-using-Dijkstra-s-Algorithm
We approach the problem statement by finding the shortest time taken to deliver the goods from one location to another. For finding the shortest route and time we use the Dijkstra Algorithm to predict the shortest time taken from one location to another using directed graphs.
